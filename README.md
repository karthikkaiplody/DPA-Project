#### Description:

  Our objective is to analyze trends in the online shoppers purchasing intention dataset using exploratory data analysis techniques, and build machine learning models to predict the purchasing intentions of visitors to a store's website. We plan to approach this as both a clustering and classification problem, grouping similar customers based on their purchasing behavior and predicting whether a new customer is likely to make a purchase based on their browsing and purchasing behavior. By applying these techniques, we hope to gain insights into customer behavior and optimize marketing strategies to increase sales.

#### Questions that the project seeks to address:

    1. To find which subset of the 10 numerical and 8 categorical attributes of a data set has an strong impact to predict purchasing intention of customer.

    2. To find which attributes are highly correlated so as to reduce number of predictor variables, to make model simpler.

    3. To identify which attributes has an positive and negative impact on customer purchasing intention.

    4. What are the distinct purchasing patterns among the online shoppers and how do these patterns differ based on demographic and behavioural factors?

#### Data Source
